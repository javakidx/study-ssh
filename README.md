# study-ssh
These are the codes that I practice coding when studying Spring, Struts and Hibernate.
## Project ReadingList
### Actuator
- To get a bean wiring report, perform request to ```http://localhost:8000/beans```.
## Project readinglist
The project named [readinglist](https://github.com/javakidx/study-ssh/tree/master/readinglist) is a Spring Boot project created with Groovy.
### Running tests with the CLI
- To run the test again ReadingListController.groovy, use command as ```spring test tests/ReadingListControllerTest.groovy```.
- To test the ReadingListControllerSpect, use the command as ```sprint test tests```(this will run ReadingListControllerTest.groovy, too)
